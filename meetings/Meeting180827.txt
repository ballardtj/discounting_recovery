### DESIGN OF MODEL RECOVERY ANALYSIS ###

1) Sampling distributions
    
    - sample from obtained distributions. For each sample in the recovery analysis,
      randomly sample a chain, subject, and iteration and select the values for all 
      parameters. 
    - generate 100 datasets for that parameter value. Fit to each one.
    - repeat 100 times to cover the parameter space.

2) Choice set 
    - start with Manos choice set

3) Analysis procedure

Option 1) Maximum likelihood, single subject (start with this one)

Option 2) Bayesian, single subject

Option 3) Bayesian, multiple subject


Next step after that - model recovery
