### REVIEW OF RESULTS FROM MODEL FITS ###

Tim to do: 

Tim to do: Plot posterior predictives, calculate BIC

Tim to do: Implement as Bayes, get priors from distributions of parameters in original papers


### Datasets ###

1) Manos' dataset where people choose between delayed and immediate alternative

2) Junyi's dataset where people choose between two delayed alternatives (also has built in effects)

### Authorship ###

Tim potentially to take lead as first author

### Models ###

TIM TO DO: fit models in ML based on Manos dataset

Need to think about bounds for DE algorithm. 

#Utility-based

    exponential discounting
    hyberbolic discounting (classic version)
    hyberbolic discounting (2-parameter myseron & green version) On slack - a comparison of four models of delay discounting in humans.  1/(1+K*D)^theta

#Attribute-wise models

    proportional difference (Cheng & Goncalez)
    trade-off (sholten et al., 2014)
    ITCH (Ericsson)
    DRIFT (Read et al) JEP:LMC (on slack) - DRIFT - an analysis of outcome framing in inter temporal choice


#TIM TO DO: have a think about structure of the paper
